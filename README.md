Backend (Node.js & MongoDB)

Task Management API:

Create a Task: Allow users to create a task with:
Title, description, assigned user, and status (Pending, In Progress, Completed).

Update a Task: Update task status or reassign to another user.
List Tasks: Fetch tasks with optional filters (e.g., status or assigned user).

Logic Challenges:
Prevent a task from being updated to Completed if it does not have a description.
Validate that the assigned user exists before creating or updating a task.
